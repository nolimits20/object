    // Question 1: Create an object representing a car with properties like make, model, and year. Add a method to the car object that displays information about the car.Create two instances of the car object and call the method on each.

    const car = {
        make: "Benz",
        model: "Glk",
        year: 2011,
        displayInfo: function() {
            console.log(`This car is a ${this.make} ${this.model} from ${this.year}`)
        }
    }
    car.displayInfo();

    // Question 2: Create an object representing a student with properties name, age, and grades (an array of numbers). Add a method to the student object that calculates and returns the average grade. Create two instances of the student object with different grades and display their average grades.

    const student = {
        name: "Oladele",
        age: 33,
        grades: [90, 80, 80, 60],
        averageGrades: function() {
            let sum = 0;
            for (let i = 0; i < this.grades.length; i++) {
                sum += this.grades[i];
            }
            return sum / this.grades.length;
